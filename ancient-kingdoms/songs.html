Original Lyrics

Do not cross the river,  
Please, my love, please stay.  
(公無渡河)  
But you would not listen,  
And drifted far away.  
(公竟渡河)  
Now you are gone—  
Lost beneath the stream.  
(墮河而死)  
My joy has vanished;  
Alas, what shall I do?  
(當奈公何)


New Lyrics

Do not cross the river,  
Please, my love, please stay.  
The wind was cold and bitter,  
Yet you walked away.  

I called your name, but silence fell,  
The water took you in its spell.  
My hands reached out, but only air,  
And now you’re gone—forever, nowhere.  

Do not cross the river,  
Please, my love, please stay.  
But you would not listen,  
And drifted far away.  
Now you are gone—  
Lost beneath the stream.  
My joy has vanished;  
Alas, what shall I do?  

Shadows on the water,  
Echoes on the shore.  
Every step I wander,  
I can’t find you anymore.  

Your laughter fades like twilight’s song,  
The night feels empty, dark, and long.  
If I could turn the river’s tide,  
I’d hold you close, back by my side.  

Do not cross the river,  
Please, my love, please stay.  
But you would not listen,  
And drifted far away.  
Now you are gone—  
Lost beneath the stream.  
My joy has vanished;  
Alas, what shall I do?  

If love could build a bridge of light,  
I’d walk across, I’d hold you tight.  
But rivers flow, and time won’t bend,  
I lost you once, I lose again.  

Do not cross the river,  
Please, my love, please stay.  
But you would not listen,  
And drifted far away.  
Now you are gone—  
Lost beneath the stream.  
My joy has vanished;  
Alas, what shall I do?  

Do not cross the river…  
Alas, what shall I do?

Turtle, O Turtle!  
Show us your head!  
If you will not show it,  
We will burn you,  
We will roast you,  
We will eat you!  

Knock on the shell—will you answer back?  
Knock-knock! Knock-knock!  

Show us, show us—Turtle hear our cry,  
Till the turtle comes!  
Show us, show us—Turtle hear our cry,  
We will all be one!  

River runs steady, sky like a bell,  
Voices together calling the shell.  
Do not be afraid—step into the sun,  
When we keep the rhythm, many hearts are one.  

Send us the one who will unite us!  
Give us the ruler who will guide us!  
Turtle, O Turtle, we will keep you safe.  
Show us your head—come join our pace.  

Show us, show us—Turtle hear our cry,  
Till the turtle comes!  
Show us, show us—Turtle hear our cry,  
We will all be one!  

Show us, show us—Turtle hear our cry,  
Let the daylight shine!  
Show us, show us—Turtle hear our cry,  
We will walk the line!  

Show us, show us—Turtle hear our cry,  
Voices loud and strong!  
Show us, show us—Turtle hear our cry,  
We all sing along!  

Show us, show us—Turtle hear our cry,

Show us, show us—Turtle hear our cry,

Old Lyrics (Jeongeupsa)

O moon, climb high into the night,  
Shine your silver light afar—  
(ᄃᆞᆯ하 노피곰 도ᄃᆞ샤)
Shine upon the roads he travels,  
Guide him safely home to me.  
(어긔야 머리곰 비취오시라)
Ah, my heart—how it trembles!  
(어긔야 어강됴리 아으 다롱디리)

Is he still lingering in the marketplace?  
Tell me, moon, where his footsteps go.  
(져재 녀러신고요)
Watch that he not stumble, not falter,  
Nor sink into the dark and troubled mire.  
(어긔야 즌ᄃᆡ를 드ᄃᆡ욜셰라)
Ah, my heart—how it trembles!  
(어긔야 어강됴리)

All the goods he carries, let them be—  
Let him leave them, let them fall aside.  
(어느이다 노코시라)
Only haste, only return, my love—  
Before his heart grows weary, before his flame burns dim.  
(어긔야 내 가논ᄃᆡ 점그ᄅᆞᆯ셰라)
Ah, my heart—how it trembles!
(어긔야 어강됴리 아으 다롱디리)


New Lyrics

Moonlight light, climb the sky,  
Shine upon the road so high.  
Guide his feet and guard his way,  
Bring him safely home today.  

Moonlight light… climb the sky…  
Moonlight light… guard his way…  

Moonlight light, my heart is weak,  
Moonlight light, the one I seek.  
Do not let him stumble, fall,  
Guide him home through shadows all.  

Moonlight light—ah, ah—  
Moonlight light—ah, ah—  
Guide him back, guide him back,  
Guide him home to me.  

If his hands grow tired and sore,  
Moonlight light, protect him more.  
If his heart grows faint with fear,  
Moonlight light, draw him near.  

Moonlight light… protect him more…  
Moonlight light… draw him near…  

Goods may scatter, gold may fade,  
None of it counts, no price is paid.  
Let the burdens fall aside,  
Only love must be my guide.  

Moonlight light, so pale, so near,  
Take away my trembling fear.  
Tell me where his footsteps go,  
Bring him safe from night’s shadow.  

Moonlight light—ah, ah—  
Moonlight light—ah, ah—  
Guide him back, guide him back,  
Guide him home to me.  

Moonlight light, across the sea,  
Shine the path and let him see.  
If the waters surge and rise,  
Keep him safe beneath your eyes.  

Moonlight light… across the sea…  
Moonlight light… beneath your eyes…  

Ah, my heart—how it trembles!  
Ah, my heart—how it trembles!  
Ah, my heart—how it trembles!  

Moonlight light! Moonlight light!  
Guide him—home to me!

Original Poem

Three forks, five leaves, 
(三椏五葉)
Turning from sun to shade.  
(背陽向陰)
If you wish to seek me,  
(欲來求我)
Look beneath the jujube tree.
(假樹相尋)


New Lyrics

Three forks, five leaves,
Turning from sun to shade.
If you wish to seek me,
Look beneath the jujube tree.

Fog drifts low through silent pines,
Foxes stir where dawnlight shines.
Roots entwine where rivers start,
Whispering life from the mountain’s heart.

Three forks, five leaves,
Turning from sun to shade.
If you wish to seek me,
Look beneath the jujube tree.

Root of the mountain, child of stone,
Drinking mist where no man’s gone.
Hidden deep where tigers tread,
Dreaming under pine-tree bed.

Night descends with silver hue,
Owls call out and fade from view.
Still I sleep through storm and frost,
In silence rich, yet never lost.

Three forks, five leaves,
Turning from sun to shade.
If you wish to seek me,
Look beneath the jujube tree.

Rain on rock, and snow on moss,
Years pass slow, no moment lost.
Hands of healers find my face,
Lift me softly from my place.

Steamed in pots, dried in sun,
Gift of earth to everyone.
Carried far by boat and steed,
For kings who thirst, for hearts in need.

Three forks, five leaves,
Turning from sun to shade.
If you wish to seek me,
Look beneath the jujube tree.

Sailors hum as sails unfold,
River turns its threads of gold.
Monks recite beneath the pine,
Blessing each root as a sacred sign.

Markets gleam with distant lands,
Ink and scrolls in merchants’ hands.
Songs of ginseng cross the plain,
Echoes carried home again.

Three forks, five leaves,
Turning from sun to shade.
If you wish to seek me,
Look beneath the jujube tree.

Silk for roots, gold for trade,
Voices ring through hill and glade.
Banners flutter, horses neigh,
Rivers sing along the way.

From mountain heart our fortune flows,
From forest depths our courage grows.
Once we bled, now we stand tall,
Ginseng’s power runs through all.

Three forks, five leaves,
Turning from sun to shade.
If you wish to seek me,
Look beneath the jujube tree.

Hammers ring and towers climb,
Bells of iron mark the time.
Through each soul the root still gleams,
Binding earth to ancient dreams.

Three forks, five leaves,
Turning from sun to shade.
If you wish to seek me,
Look beneath the jujube tree.

Though kingdoms fall and rivers turn,
Still in the soil my heart will burn.
Three forks, five leaves,
Turning from sun to shade.
If you wish to seek me,
Look beneath the jujube tree.

Original Song

Two birds fly side by side, 
(翩翩黃鳥)
But I am left alone.  
(雌雄相依)
Where is the one I love?  
(念我之獨)
My heart longs and longs again.
(誰其與歸)


New Lyrics

Two birds fly side by side,
But I am left alone.
Where is the one I love?
My heart longs and longs again.

I watched you leave, standing on the fortress stone,
A story of love that the kingdom has known.
They see the King, the great warrior, the man of the wars,
They don't see the hole ripped right through my core.
Every scroll, every banner, every jewel feels cold,
My future is broken, my history untold.

Two birds fly side by side,
But I am left alone.
Where is the one I love?
My heart longs and longs again.

Two birds fly side by side,
But I am left alone.
Where is the one I love?
My heart longs and longs again.

Two birds fly side by side,
But I am left alone.
Where is the one I love?
My heart longs and longs again.

The lights of the capital city still burn bright,
But the halls are empty now, drowning in night.
I hear a faint whisper carried on the line,
A memory of your smile, that was once only mine.
I trace your name in the dust of the windowpane,
Knowing you'll never feel the warmth of my rain.

Two birds fly side by side,
But I am left alone.
Where is the one I love?
My heart longs and longs again.

Fly high, my love, go where your heart demands,
I search the ground, but hold only sand.
I should hate the mountain, hate the crown, hate the throne,
But I only hate the feeling of standing alone.

Two orioles in morning sun...
Their harmony is known...
But I am left alone...
My heart longs and longs again...
